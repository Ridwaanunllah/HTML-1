    <h1><u>Apple</u></h1>
    <p>Apples are a good source of nutrients, including fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants which can help support healthy 
        digestion, brain health, and weight management. There is evidence that apples can also protect against certain 
        chronic diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
