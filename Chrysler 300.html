    <h1><u>Chrysler_300</u></h1>
    <p>The five-seat Chrysler 300 is one of the few remaining traditional, full-size sedans from a mainstream brand.
         Power comes from a standard 3.6-liter V-6 engine that makes 292 horsepower (300 hp in the 300S trim level) 
         or an optional 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission. V-6 versions
          are available with rear-or all-wheel drive, while V-8 models are RWD-only. 
          Competitors include the <i><b>Toyota Avalon</b></i> and <i><b>Dodge Charger.</b></i></p>

          <p>A slimmer trim lineup features Touring, Touring L and S models. All but the base Touring trim add front and rear
             parking sensors, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. The Red S Appearance Package introduced 
             last year is now part of the S trim, giving it special badging, black and red exterior accents and 
             black 20-inch wheels. </p>
