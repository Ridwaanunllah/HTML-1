         <p>The XE was announced, but not displayed, at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show and debuted globally on 8 September 2014
             in London.Sales were expected to begin globally in 2015, followed by the United States in 2016.
             Production formally commenced on 13 April 2015 at Jaguar Land Rover's Solihull plan</p>
        <p>The XE was the first application of Jaguar Land Rover's new 2.0 L turbocharged Ingenium four-cylinder engine.
            The Ingenium technology licenses the Multiair/UniAir electrohydraulic variable valve lift system from
             Schaeffler.Group, which Schaeffler in turn licensed from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2001. The system,
              developed by Fiat Powertrain Technologies, is a hydraulically-actuated variable valve lift (VVL) technology enabling 
                   "cylinder by cylinder, stroke by stroke" control of intake air directly via a gasoline engine's 
                   inlet valves.The four-cylinder is available in both petrol and diesel variants, in a range of 
                   different power outputs. The 163 PS (120 kW; 161 hp) diesel significantly reduced consumption and
                    carbon emission figures, and is capable of fuel consumption less than 68.9 mpgâ€‘imp 
                    (4.10 L/100 km; 57.4 mpg US) and producing CO2 emissions of only 99 g/km. The cleanest 
                    models in Britain pay no annual Vehicle Excise Duty.</p>
