    <h1><u>Nissan_Infiniti QX60</u></h1>
    <p>The design of QX60 is deeply rooted in INFINITI's heritage. Inspired by the Japanese concept of “Ma,” QX60 
        embraces the space between its lines and curves to eye-catching, minimalist effect.
        INFINITI has long believed that Luxury Should Be Lived In. Now, you can enjoy that same real-world luxury with
         your whole familyt hrough every commute,carpool and cross-state drive to Grandma. </p>
