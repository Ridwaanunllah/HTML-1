    <h1><u>Strawberry</u></h1>
    <p>Antioxidants in strawberries, including vitamin C, can support your immune system and may lower your chances of 
        getting sick when you're around germs. They may also help curb inflammation, manage your blood sugar, 
        and guard against health conditions like high cholesterol, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
