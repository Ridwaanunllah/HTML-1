<h1><big><u>The Elephant and the Fox</u></big></h1>
<body>
    <hr>
    <p>There were a fox and an elephant in a forest. The two lived very intimately. 
        so much so that one cannot leave the other.<p> Across the river was a sugarcane field. 
            One day, the elephant wanted to eat sugarcane. The elephant said this to the fox: 
            "Today I want to eat sugarcane," to which the fox replied, "Yes, I also want to eat." 
            "It has been a long day, and I have not eaten."</p><hr>

            <hr>
        <p>The elephant said, "I will carry you on my back."
        
        The elephant carried the fox on his back and crossed the river. Together, they went to the sugarcane field. 
        The fox ate quickly and got full, but the elephant's stomach did not get full. 
        The full-bellied fox was mesmerized and howled loudly with joy.</p><hr>
        
        <p>"Don't shout loudly; if anyone hears, they will come and beat both of them," said the elephant.
         But the fox did not listen to the elephant. Hearing the fox's shout, the owner of the farm came.
         <hr>
        The fox ran fast and escaped the blows. But the elephant was heavy and big, 
        so it could not escape the owner's blows. He hit the elephant hard. 
        The elephant somehow escaped from him and came across the field.</p><hr>
        
        <hr>
        <p>At last, the fox and the elephant met on the bank of the river. The elephant asked the fox, 
        "Why did you do this?"
        
        <p>Then the fox replied, "I have a habit of howling when my stomach is full." 
        The elephant did not say anything. Then the river had to be crossed from that bank to this bank. 
        As before, the elephant came to the middle of the river, carrying the fox on its back.
         When the elephant reached the middle of the river, it plunged into the water and proceeded to bathe.</p><hr>
        
         
        <p>Then the fox got completely scared. Angry with that, it shouted, "What are you doing?"
         "If you do that, I will really drown in the river and die."
        
        to which the elephant said, "I have a habit of taking a bath in the river after eating sugarcane."</p>
        
        At last the foxl thought to himself, "The elephant will take revenge for my indecent act." 
        Then the fox realized his mistake and apologized to the elephant. </p>
       <p> Finally, the elephant brought the fox safely to the shore. From that day on,
         the fox did not harm any creature, and the fox continued to live as good friends with the elephant as before.</p>
        
        <p><b><h4>Moral of the story</h4></b></p>
        If one does not do good, it is not bad, but one should not wish for evil. 
        If we do evil to another for our own happiness, we will have to experience its double consequences one day.</p>
